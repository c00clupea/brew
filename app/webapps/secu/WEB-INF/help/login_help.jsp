        At first, try to throw an exception
        <br/>
        Perhaps there are some values which are not allowed? <br/>
    Is there a XSS-flaw or possibly an SQL-Injection possibility?<br/>
    Perhaps there is a problem with the session?
    <p>
        Then look at the Controller (LoginController)
    </p>
    Now fix the problem...perhaps there are some code documentation artifacts which will help?
